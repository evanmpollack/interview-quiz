# Welcome

Welcome to the REQ Developer quiz. This quiz will test your HTML and CSS skills. The quiz will be due on the day of your interview, during which we will look over your code and give you a chance to explain your methods. The reason behind this quiz is to give you a real life example of what might be asked from you if you were to work here, as well as to see your knowledge in action.

## The Quiz

The main goal of the quiz is to build out a press page based on the design mock attached (mock.png). When you are done, zip the files together and email it back. 

### Requirements:
 - Build out page that matches the mock, using CSS and HTML
 - Link CSS and JS files
 - Use semantic HTML
 - Use media queries to make it responsive (you can use your best judgement here)

Good luck!

**This is a web page I created for an interview in the past**

## The Quiz

The main goal of the quiz was to build out a press page based on the design mock attached. 

## Quiz Requirements:
 - Build out page that matches the mock, using CSS and HTML
 - Link CSS and JS files
 - Use semantic HTML
 - Use media queries to make it responsive (you can use your best judgement here)
